# Steps to build Code::Blocks version 13.12 linked with wxGTK3.0 under Debian 8.0 "Jessie"
# I am doing this to learn how to build deb files
# If you just want to build Code::Blocks; the bootstrap, configure, and make method is better.
# The only thing nice about this way is the "apt-get build-dep codeblocks" installs the needs debs for building.


# Add Code::Blocks source location needed for "apt-get source codeblocks"
su
# edit the file /etc/apt/sources.list
nano /etc/apt/sources.list
# add the next line using the editor
deb-src http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ sid main
apt-get update
exit

# Downloads and unpacks the debian source files
mkdir -p ~/devel/deb_source_libs
cd ~/devel/deb_source_libs
apt-get source codeblocks

# Installs the packages needed to build Code::Blocks from source
# It installs wxGTK 3.0 instead of wxGTK 2.8; Code::Blocks currently has more bugs when linked with wxGTK 3.0.
su
apt-get build-dep codeblocks
exit

# Builds Code::Blocks deb files
cd ~/devel/deb_source_libs/codeblocks-13.12
dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -uc

cd ~
cd ./devel/deb_source_libs
su
# note the deb file names change with time recently the ending "-3.1_amd64.deb" was changed from "-3_amd64.deb"
